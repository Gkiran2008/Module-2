# EXP2-Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

##  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## Program
~~~
a=16 
print(bin(a))
~~~
## Output
![438656764-1cdfe979-f525-46c1-964b-bfce00b3d4aa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdcd1010-bf8d-4800-aa28-79c2e581113b)

## Result
Thus the program has been successfully executed
